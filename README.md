HITUP: Heart Illness Threat Uncovering Predictor
🩺 Overview
HITUP is a predictive model designed to assess the likelihood of heart disease based on patient symptoms, lifestyle choices, medical history, and other risk factors. It utilizes a labeled dataset of 70,000+ records, making it a powerful tool for early detection and awareness.

📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains 70,000+ entries with 19 features, including symptoms, medical conditions, lifestyle factors, and the target variable Heart_Risk.

🧬 Features
Feature	Description
Chest_Pain	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Shortness_of_Breath	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Fatigue	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Palpitations	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Dizziness	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Swelling	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Pain_Arms_Jaw_Back	1 if present, 0 otherwise
Cold_Sweats_Nausea	1 if present, 0 otherwise
High_BP	1 if the patient has high blood pressure
High_Cholesterol	1 if cholesterol is high
Diabetes	1 if the patient has diabetes
Smoking	1 if the patient is a smoker
Obesity	1 if BMI > standard threshold
Sedentary_Lifestyle	1 if physically inactive
Family_History	1 if family has heart disease history
Chronic_Stress	1 if under chronic stress
Gender	1 = Male, 0 = Female
Age	Patient age in years
Heart_Risk	Target variable: 1 = High risk, 0 = Low risk

Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
X = df.drop('Heart_Risk', axis=1)
y = df['Heart_Risk']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Make predictions:

python
Copy
Edit
prediction = model.predict([[1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 55]])
print("Heart Disease Risk:", "High" if prediction[0] == 1 else "Low")
💡 Goals
Early detection of heart disease using health and lifestyle indicators.

Educating users and doctors about high-risk patterns.

Building an intuitive interface for health prediction.

🚀 Future Work
Integrate a web-based prediction dashboard using Streamlit or Flask.

Add data visualizations and user input forms.

Implement feature importance analysis and explainable AI.
